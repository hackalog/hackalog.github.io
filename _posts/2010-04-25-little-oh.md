Why is it impossible to find a nontrivial example of someone using little-oh notation?

Recall, little oh is defined as follows. We write $latex f(x) = o(g(x))$ if

$latex \\lim \_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0$.

Let's say I want to get rid of silly little terms like $latex \\log \\log x$. Notice that:

$latex \\log\\log x = e^{\\log\\log\\log x} = e^{(\\log\\log x) \\frac{\\log \\log \\log x}{\\log \\log x}} = (\\log x)^{\\frac{\\log \\log \\log x}{\\log \\log x}}$.

Of course, $latex \\lim\_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\log \\log \\log x}{\\log \\log x} = 0$, so this exponent is $latex o(1)$.

Using this trick, we can rewrite expressions in this way:

$latex \\log x \\log \\log x = (\\log x)^{1+o(1)},$

and hence all the ugly little log terms have been swept under the rug.
